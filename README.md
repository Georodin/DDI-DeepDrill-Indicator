# DDI-DeepDrill-Indicator
a deep drill resource indicator for better visualization of the diffrent locations

Tired of hovering above every deep drill resource till you find right one?

This mod simply adds a overlay to all found deep drill resources, so you don't have to hover over every single one!
You need a powered Ground-penetrating scanner in order display found resources.

Let me know about bugs or improvements here or at Steam...
